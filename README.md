# Simple Bitwarden Workflow for Alfred

Simple yet powerful integration with the Bitwarden CLI so you can now get your passwords out of your Bitwarden vault and straight into the clipboard from within Alfred.

**Note**: Passwords with spaces at the beginning or end are _NOT_ supported

## Version 1.3.0 update - Please Read

-----
* Update workflow python package to version 1.37 with support for Alfred 4
* Add filtering support for Bitwarden folders #12

**Syntax:**

`bw -f folder_name search_string`

-- or original syntax --

`bw search_string`

Thank you, @rustycamper, for your contribution!

Thank you, @rasmusbe, for contributing.

## Version 1.2.0 update - Please Read

Ladies and gents, I am happy to present v1.2.0 of the workflow.
As this workflow was originally a fork from the LastPass CLI it is now almost completely a rewritten codebase without using AppleScript calling an external applescript file to ask for the password. That is done now via inline AppleScript in Python.

All perl and main AppleScripts have been rewritten in Python.

If you haven't used Bitwarden before... you are crazy and you should! Say bye to LastPass and hello to selfhosting. It is the single greatest password manager package out there :D so check it out at [https://bitwarden.com](https://bitwarden.com).

## Version 1.1.0 update - Please Read

Ladies and gents, I am happy to present v1.1.0 of the workflow. Before I continue, this workflow has not been developed from scratch. The LastPass CLI workflow was the start and was remodeled to fit the Bitwarden CLI. Nonetheless it was a SIGNIFICANT amount of work for me so if you like it and use it, please say thank you by donating towards my organic food. Any amount will do, whatever you feel the value is for you/your business/your time :)

I have never used LastPass, I prefer to selfhost my applications. From the day I heard about Bitwarden I loved it - that was at the beginning of this year (2018).
